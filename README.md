## Hi there 👋

I’ve spent years keeping IT systems running smoothly… now I’m on a mission to break them (safely!) and make them stronger.  

I’m exploring the world of Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing, and Red/Purple Team operations — finding weak spots, learning from them, and building defenses.  

Some things I’m working on right now:  
- **VA Lab** – Hunting vulnerabilities in a simulated enterprise network  
- **WebApp Pentest** – Taking on OWASP Top 10 challenges in DVWA/bWAPP  
- **Purple Team Lab** – Phishing simulations and endpoint defense exercises  

CEH certification is coming in **April 2026** — until then, I’m building projects, learning new tools, and sharing what I discover. Let’s make security fun!
